Adds ugly/annoying desktop notifications to Messenger.

Before [Facebook Messenger](https://m.me/) was reskinned in 2020(?),
it supported desktop notifications. After the reskin, it lost search
and notification functionality. They readded search functionality, but
still havenâ€™t reimplemented desktop notifications. They only have
sounds (which I like to keep disabled).

This script is annoying and will renotify you about 2/3 times per
notification and will lag behind. But it is better than going for
hours without noticing that you received messages!
