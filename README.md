Adds ugly/annoying desktop notifications to Messenger.

Before [Facebook Messenger](https://m.me/) was reskinned in 2020(?),
it supported desktop notifications. After the reskin, it [lost
search](https://www.reddit.com/r/facebook/comments/kbd0re/facebook_messenger_missing_the_option_to_search/)
and notification functionality. They readded search functionality
(sometime before 2021-09-17), but still havenâ€™t reimplemented desktop
notifications. They only have sounds (which I like to keep disabled).

This script is annoying and will renotify you about 2/3 times per
notification and will lag behind. But it is better than going for
hours without noticing that you received messages!
